    <h3>Deadpool 2</h3>
      <p>“Its profanity-filled, self-mocking humour is becoming just a bit wearisome, though. When the Avengers, X-Men et al have the same tongue in-cheek quality anyway, it’s a moot point whether Ryan Reynolds’ schtick as the sardonic hero is any different from what we get with Wolverine or Iron Man. After a while here, the action gets in the way of the comedy which gets in the way of the action... and so on and so on...”</p>
      <p> - Geoffrey Mcnab - The Independant  3 Stars</p>

      <div>
          <p>"Deadpool is in a different league – or at least a different age rating. Where most superhero movies have gone family and broad, Deadpool went adult and rude, and revelled in the possibilities a UK 15 or US R rating opened up in terms of “strong bloody violence”, “strong language” and “crude depictions of sexual acts”, to quote the British Board of Film Classification."</p>
          <p> - Steve Rose - The Guardian  3 Stars</p>

      <div>
          <p>"He is angry, violent, disrespectful to everyone and everything, and at the same time thoroughly nontoxic and totally cool. Sure. Great. But there is something ever so slightly dishonest about this character, something false about the boundaries drawn around his sadism and his rage. “Deadpool 2” dabbles in ugliness and transgression, but takes no real creative risks."
          <p> - A.O Scott - The New York Times</p>

    <div class"movie 2">
      <h3>Aquaman</h3>
        <p>"“Aquaman” is an eco-conscious superhero origin story that at times is reminiscent of “Clash of the (Sopping Wet) Titans,” “Romancing the Stone,” a couple of Japanese monster movies and “The Sword in the Stone.” Am I forgetting anything? Probably. It’s also wildly in violation of nearly every law of physics, even by the loose standards of super­hero movies, not to mention dizzyingly confusing for viewers not steeped in DC Comics lore. Take your resident nerd friend, if you have one, as backup. Otherwise, be prepared to Google the heck out of this movie."</p>
