  <h3>The Beach Bum, 2019</h3>

  <p>“Like a toddler, Moondog — whose Hawaiian-print suits look like pajamas accessorized with a diaper-like fanny pack — is a creature of pure narcissistic impulse. He will never say no to a drink, a joint, a line of cocaine or a sexually available woman, and nobody ever says no to him either.</p>

    <p>What “The Beach Bum” celebrates as transgression is pure tedium. What it takes for divine lunacy is frat house doggerel. The booze flows freely. The women are topless and ornamental. The cars and boats are fast and expensive. There’s nothing much worth writing about....”</p>
    <p> - New York Times - A. O. Scott  &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>


        <p>"The Beach Bum seems to be about reacting to a moment of national/social/spiritual crisis by treating hedonism as a holy sacrament. It’s a spiritual sequel to Spring Breakers in its own warped way, although both films are clearly movies of their particular moment. Korine’s 2012 masterpiece was announcement that the revolution was arriving, and it would be clad in balaclavas and bikinis; Bum suggests that we’re more than a bit fucked right now and that you may as well protest by having a good time..."</p>
        <p> - Rolling Stone - David Fear  &#9734; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>

        <p>"I watched it in one of those movie theaters where you can order alcohol, so I absolutely did, and the combined effect of red wine and someone else’s gas-mask bong hits was unpleasantly strong. I don’t know whether Moondog is ever supposed to be reconsidering his lifestyle, but I sure was. Like a trip to Key West itself, The Beach Bum is a lot of fun until you get settled in, take a good look around, and notice that everyone is going to die in three weeks, maximum.
            It’s intoxicating, in that it results in you taking a deep breath and asking yourself, once and for all: “What are you doing with your life?”..."</p>

    <h3>What Men Want, 2019</h3>
      <p>"Henson brings a charge of energy to every scene and there are some funny moments (although a Michael Jackson joke now feels wrong). When Ali invites herself to the male execs’ poker night, her superpowers make dramatic sense: she knows how to get respect by winning and how to flatter with a strategic loss. A win for Henson..."</p>
      <p> - Peter Bradshaw - The Guardian &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>

      <p>"There’s a cosmic rightness to gender-swapping a Mel Gibson sexual politics comedy. Instead of his boorish ad exec, here we meet a boorish sports agent in Taraji P. Henson’s ferocious Ali. She too learns to be more understanding of the opposite sex when she quite literally gets inside their heads, but the gender switch makes this a very different beast.

          The storytelling is a little loose, but as a workplace comedy with a side-line in romance, this earns its laughs thanks to the immensely game Henson and a stellar supporting cast..."</p>
      <p> - Helen o’hara - Empire &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>

        <p>"“What Men Want” doesn’t stick to that conceit, however, despite such barbed moments as when Nick says aloud that he would fire Ali if he didn’t fear a #MeToo outcry. The film insists that Ali, like Gibson’s ad man, receive her comeuppance: She learns to respect her gay assistant (Josh Brener) and to be less selfish in her career and in bed.
            Memo to working women: Don’t be ball busters, or else.
            The gender politics of “What Men Want” only sometimes play as retrograde, though. The movie covers all its bases, determined to give every segment of the audience what it wants, with dubious success..."</p>

      <h3>Isn't It Romantic, 2019</h3>
        <p>"In a fun, glossy take down of age-old genre tropes, Rebel Wilson wakes up in an alternate universe, dominated by romantic comedy cliches.
            Wilson is a mostly engaging lead and while she’s not a natural with some of the later stage sentiment, her offhand line delivery elevates a number of throwaway jabs and she’s well-suited to physical comedy. The cast around her are all mostly forgettable, with Hemsworth not quite delivering the charm one would expect from such a character, Adam Devine not quite convincing as the best friend with an unrequited crush and Priyanka Chopranot quite interesting enough as the spiky love rival.
            There’s fun to be had here, especially for fans of the genre, although in an interesting, last-minute move, Warners sold the film outside of America to Netflix, a sign that while the romantic comedy might live on, it might not be on the big screen..."</p>
        <p> - Benjamin Lee - The Guardian &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>

        <p>"Wilson makes it all go down easy with her brass and sass and unfakeable warmth even during the danceathon ending in which the whole cast celebrates the rom-com aesthetic by getting down to Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance With Somebody.” Isn’t that a betrayal of everything Natalie and her movie are supposed to stand for? Yeah, maybe, but this meta-take on meet-cutes hooks you up with a few good laughs while it mocks itself. It’s a damn shame about the sucker punch of a happy ending. Still, thanks to the comic tornado at its center, Isn’t It Romantic is still your best bet for a Valentine’s date at the movies. You could do worse..."</p>
        <p> - Peter Travers - Rolling Stone &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>


          <p>"The comic actress Rebel Wilson makes any movie better — and frequently steals the show. She did it in “Pitch Perfect,” among many other films in which she plays the second lead, with a combination of oddball line readings, out-of-left-field reactions and inspired slapstick.
            Finally, we can celebrate her elevation to the star (and co-producer) of “Isn’t It Romantic,” a visually and verbally ingenious sendup of romantic comedies that wears its candy heart on its sleeve.
            If, in your jaded heart, you loathe romantic comedies, you’ll get scant satisfaction from this one. Yes, its satire has a bit of an edge, but even that edge is too good-natured for true cynics. If, however, you have a soft spot for the genre — and, aw, we won’t tell — “Isn’t It Romantic” delivers the goods, on multiple levels..."</p>
          <p> - Jane Horwitz - Washington Post &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>
