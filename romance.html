  <h3>Five Feet Apart, 2019</h3>

  <p>“Richardson may be the best thing about this Velveeta-slathered heap of lukewarm cliche, but she is merely a vicarious vehicle for thwarted teenage longing directed at the bad-boy dreamboat heartthrob of countless high-school-girl fantasies. And if you aren’t caught in the throes of those fantasies at this very moment, in your real life, you’re probably not going to find much to like here.
    Is “Five Feet Apart” trite, familiar and shamelessly manipulative? Of course. There’s even a scene in which Will and Stella strip down to their underwear and show each other their surgery scars and gastrostomy tubes, meant to show off their vulnerability. All it really proves is how far the filmmakers are willing to go to jerk your chain...”</p>
    <p> - Michael O’Sullivan - Washington Post  &#9734; &#9734;</p>


        <p>"For all its good intentions, however, Five Feet Apart drowns in the syrupy tropes of forbidden romance. Every moment of genuine tenderness — a particular swimming pool scene features quivering aplenty — is squashed by a running-through-the-airport build-up or one acoustic cover too many. Boasting two actors capable of bringing the film a head above The Fault In Our Stars and its surrounding ilk, it’s disappointing to see a film about such a challenging subject playing it safe. The alternative might be harder to watch, but would make for a far braver film more worthy of its star couple.
          Sprouse and Richardson are proven heavyweights in the young-adult pocket of Hollywood, but this soft-hearted teen romance spreads on sugary sentiment too thickly to leave a lasting message..."</p>
        <p> - Beth Webb - Empire &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>

        <p>"Trading shamelessly on any weakness for medical soap, Baldoni returns the lamentably underemployed Parminder Nagra to the doctor’s scrubs she once wore on ER, while allowing Richardson – whose smart choices were better showcased in Columbus – to lend certain moments an apple-cheeked vivacity. Yet she surely realises, as Fault’s Shailene Woodley did before her, that this is the kind of marshmallow martyrdom that has to be briskly worked through before they let you at the grownup scripts. The airlessness of the single setting – a controlled environment allowing teens to approach mortality from safe distance – is only dispelled late on, with some daffily fateful business atop a frozen lake: in this case, love means pushing your luck..."</p>

    <h3>Love, Simon, 2018</h3>
      <p>""Love, Simon" is a mainstream-styled teenage rom-com that uses every cliche in the book. There's the nerdy Vice Principal, the bacchanalian high school party, supportive yet somewhat clueless parents, witty voiceover from the protagonist, public declarations of love in front of the whole school, all held together by a stream of catchy pop tunes. But "Love, Simon"'s use of these cliches represents a huge first, because it is the story of a young closeted gay kid's difficult and often humorous march towards coming out..."</p>
      <p> - Shiela O’Malley - Roger Ebert &#9734; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>

      <p>"In this fun, engaging and intelligent drama, a teenager’s anonymous email conversation leads to complications – and love
          With its sheer warmth, openness, likability and idealism, Love, Simon won me over. It takes all the corniness and tweeness of the coming-of-age genre and transplants new heart into it. A high-school kid is about to come out as gay. This is Simon, played by 23-year-old Nick Robinson, and his story puts a smart new spin on straight romcom classics such as The Shop Around the Corner and You’ve Got Mail, with their anonymised romances..."</p>
      <p> - Peter Bradshaw - The Guardian &#9734; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>

        <p>"One thing Love, Simon handles really nicely is the way it allows its hero’s longings to flit excitably from one guy to the next, in the manner of most inchoate crushes we have when we are young. He gets his hopes up that Blue might be one person, only to rule that person out and alight on the next candidate. Meanwhile, his straight friends have a bunch of feelings towards one other, and in one case towards him, which get tangled up in his calculus, especially when a classmate called Martin (Logan Miller, terrific) snoops on a library computer and blackmails him to fulfil a romantic agenda of his own..."</p>

      <h3>A Star is Born, 2018</h3>
        <p>"“A Star Is Born” is such a great Hollywood myth that it’s no wonder Hollywood keeps telling it. Whatever the era, the director or the headliners, it relates the story of two lovers on dramatically differing paths: a famous man who’s furiously racing to the bottom (Bradley Cooper in this movie) and a woman (Lady Gaga) who’s soaring to the top. This latest and fourth version is a gorgeous heartbreaker (bring tissues). Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema. That it’s also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better..."</p>
        <p> - Manohla Dargis - The New York Times &#9734; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>

        <p>"The best version of “A Star Is Born” has always been the 1954 George Cukor version: moody, purplish, extravagant, driven by Judy Garland’s self-dramatizing fever. The scene you remember best from it, apart from Garland singing “The Man That Got Away,” is James Mason’s demented drunken slap of Garland during the Academy Awards — one of the most outrageous moments in movie history. In the new “Star Is Born,” Bradley Cooper pays homage to that moment, in a scene set at the Grammys, and actually tops it in outrageousness, in sick-joke masochistic power. And he does it convincingly. That’s part of the magnetic pull of this version — it, too, is a romance heightened by the cruel mirror of showbiz. Yet it has a naked humanity that leaves you wowed. These two people, the rising star and the fading star, are locked in a love as true as it is torn, and by the end of the movie they’ve both become us. “A Star Is Born” is a reminder of the scrappy grand passion that movies are all about..."</p>
        <p> - Owen Gleiberman - Variety &#9734; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>


          <p>"Pop diva Lady Gaga gives a perfectly creditable performance opposite Bradley Cooper (who also directs) in the latest version of old Hollywood chestnut, A Star Is Born – but this still feels like an unnecessary remake.
            It doesn’t add anything we haven’t already seen in the Janet Gaynor (1937), Judy Garland (1954) or Barbra Streisand (1976) versions. Worse, Cooper fails to harness Lady Gaga’s greatest quality as a performer, namely her flamboyance and outrageousness. Her character here is disappointingly conventional and even a little bland: a would-be singer in a dead-end job who keeps a picture of Carole King on her wall..."</p>
          <p> - Geoffrey Macnab - The Independent &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>
