  <div class="movie-1">
    <h3>Deadpool 2, 2018</h3>

    <p>“Its profanity-filled, self-mocking humour is becoming just a bit wearisome, though. When the Avengers, X-Men et al have the same tongue in-cheek quality anyway, it’s a moot point whether Ryan Reynolds’ schtick as the sardonic hero is any different from what we get with Wolverine or Iron Man. After a while here, the action gets in the way of the comedy which gets in the way of the action... and so on and so on...”</p>
      <p> - Geoffrey Mcnab - The Independant  &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>


          <p>"Deadpool is in a different league – or at least a different age rating. Where most superhero movies have gone family and broad, Deadpool went adult and rude, and revelled in the possibilities a UK 15 or US R rating opened up in terms of “strong bloody violence”, “strong language” and “crude depictions of sexual acts”, to quote the British Board of Film Classification..."</p>
          <p> - Steve Rose - The Guardian  &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>

          <p>"He is angry, violent, disrespectful to everyone and everything, and at the same time thoroughly nontoxic and totally cool. Sure. Great. But there is something ever so slightly dishonest about this character, something false about the boundaries drawn around his sadism and his rage. “Deadpool 2” dabbles in ugliness and transgression, but takes no real creative risks..."</p>
          <p> - A.O Scott - The New York Times &#9734; &#9734;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="movie-2">
      <h3>Aquaman, 2019</h3>
        <p>"“Aquaman” is an eco-conscious superhero origin story that at times is reminiscent of “Clash of the (Sopping Wet) Titans,” “Romancing the Stone,” a couple of Japanese monster movies and “The Sword in the Stone.” Am I forgetting anything? Probably. It’s also wildly in violation of nearly every law of physics, even by the loose standards of super­hero movies, not to mention dizzyingly confusing for viewers not steeped in DC Comics lore. Take your resident nerd friend, if you have one, as backup. Otherwise, be prepared to Google the heck out of this movie..."</p>
        <p> - Michael O'Sullivan - Washington Post &#9734;</p>

        <p>"Imagine if someone cut together all the biggest action sequences from the last few decades of Hollywood, resulting in a mash of Tron, Avatar, Clash Of The Titans, Superman, Jurassic Park, and Gladiator. Imagine a film where an octopus gets a drum solo, and it isn’t among the top ten weirdest moments. Welcome to Aquaman, where you won’t have a clue what’s going on, but you won’t be able to look away either..."</p>
        <p> - Helen o’hara - Empire &#9734; &#9734;</p>

          <p>"He’s the laughing stock of the DC Comics Extended Universe — and Aquaman’s solo movie almost gets by on razzle dazzle, since that’s all it has up its waterlogged sleeve. Not that this underwater superhero knows much from sleeves: A shirtless but never humorless Jason Momoa plays Arthur Curry, a.k.a. Aquaman, as if he were born to wield a trident. Yes, he looks nothing like the platinum blondie of the comic books. His
            half brother, King Orm (Patrick Wilson, in for the fun of it), is the one taking on that visage, complete with a dash of Draco Malfoy villainy. “I am the Ocean Master,” says Orm, seriously and hilariously. Ok, then..."</p>

      <div class="movie-3">
        <h3>Avengers: Infinity War, 2018</h3>
          <p>"Avengers: Infinity War sets out to accomplish a feat never previously attempted in Hollywood: bring together all the heroes of a sprawling superhero universe in a cohesive narrative while delivering an event that justifies 10 years and 18 movies worth of build up. There is an unprecedented amount of hype surrounding the latest installment in Marvel Studios' Marvel Cinematic Universe, but an unprecedented level of expectations as well. The question of Avengers: Infinity War was whether Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige and directors Anthony and Joe Russo could meet or exceed those expectations. Avengers: Infinity War delivers an exciting culmination of the MCU, though it's overstuffed and suffers from certain typical Marvel movie problems..."</p>
          <p> - Screenrant - Molly Freeman &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>

          <p>"Not infinity perhaps, but a really, really big finity war. Colossal, cataclysmic, delirious, preposterous – and always surreally entertaining in the now well-established Marvel movie tradition. It’s a gigantic showdown between a force of cosmic wickedness and a chaotically assembled super-team of Marvel superheroes made more complicated by Doctor Strange’s tendency to multiclone himself in moments of battle stress..."</p>
          <p> - Peter Bradshaw - The Guardian &#9734; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;</p>

            <p>"‘Avengers: Infinity War’ is stunningly dark. But it’s still wildly entertaining.</p>

            <p>"That question lies at the heart of “Avengers: Infinity War,” the at-once dark, maddeningly open-ended yet fiercely entertaining new chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), which pits the titular global do-gooders — still scattered hither and yon after their 2016 falling-out with one another in “Captain America: Civil War” — against a cosmic villain who has been coyly signaling his evil intentions since the very first “Avengers” movie, in 2012. And that’s without ever really appearing on-screen, except in teasing cameos..."</p>
